Welcome to The Odin Project!

It's great to have you with us while you learn web development!  It can be a bit overwhelming at first, so to get you started here are a few tips:


1: Set a weekly goal

Figure out how many hours each week that you can devote to learning and set this as your learning goal in your <%= link_to "profile", edit_user_registration_url(@user) %>. Avoid setting a goal to complete a certain number of lessons each week so that you can complete the curriculum within in a specific time frame. This leads to frustration because the lessons are not the same length and the complexity of the lessons, exercises, and projects will increase.


2: Start with Foundations

Everyone should start with <%= link_to "Foundations", path_url("foundations") %>. Whether you are brand new to programming or have some experience, it is important to complete our curriculum in order because it builds on itself.

If you have some experience and are tempted to skip lessons, it is highly recommended to complete each lesson and project because people often misjudge how much they know. Instead of skipping entire lessons, you can skim through the material in a lesson that you already know. By following this approach, people often discover how much foundational knowledge they were missing.


3: Join our Discord community

Everyone is encouraged to join our Discord community to ask questions about our lessons and projects. People that are ahead of you in the curriculum, as well as the people that wrote and maintain the curriculum, are always around and happy to help nudge you in the right direction.

To join our Discord server, visit our <%= link_to "community", community_url %> for more information on our community rules and expectations.


4: Tell your friends!

If you find the project helpful, please spread the word. It's always more fun to learn with friends :)
